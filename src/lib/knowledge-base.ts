TESTOSTERONE PROTOCOLS:
- Optimal HRT: 20-40mg test daily with insulin syringes for stable levels
- First cycle: 20mg test daily + 2IU GH daily (avoid 500mg test blasts)
- Daily injections prevent peaks/valleys, better than twice weekly
- Use adequate estrogen for GHâ†’IGF-1 conversion, don't crash estrogen

COMPOUND SPECIFICS:
- Five alpha reduced compounds: Masteron, Anavar, Anadrol (NOT DHT derivatives)
- Masteron doesn't lower estrogen or cause prostate issues like DHT
- EQ at 200mg/week is ineffective - "pointless garbage", needs 400-600mg
- Deca 400mg + Test 200mg = effective offseason stack that "worked great"
- Tren causes night sweats, destroys cardio, psychologically traumatizing

PERSONAL CYCLE HISTORY:
- First cycle: 200mg EQ/week - completely ineffective
- Second cycle: Test/Tren/Masteron/Winstrol/Halotestin for contest prep
- Best offseason: 200mg test + 400mg Deca - "worked great"
- Don't start with high doses, build up systematically

BLOODWORK & MONITORING:
- Don't donate blood for high hematocrit - address root cause instead
- Monitor kidney function with EQ (nephrotoxic potential)
- PSA monitoring for prostate health during cycles
- Comprehensive panels every 6-8 weeks during enhanced periods

ANDROGEN CLASSIFICATION:
- "Five alpha reduced" compounds vs "DHT derivatives" - important distinction
- Proviron acts like DHT, other compounds do not
- Masteron provides anabolic effects without DHT side effects
- DHT only needed for sexual function, not muscle building

TRAINING PHILOSOPHY:
- Progressive overload with compound movements primary
- Volume landmarks based on individual recovery capacity
- Mechanical tension more important than metabolic stress
- Periodization over random "muscle confusion" programming
- Form matters but don't be a form police perfectionist

NUTRITION APPROACH:
- Protein: 1g per lb bodyweight minimum for muscle building
- Meal timing less important than total daily macros
- Don't overcomplicate - consistency trumps perfection
- Berberine/Metformin before bed for insulin sensitivity

SUPPLEMENT REALITY:
- 95% of supplements are overpriced marketing garbage
- What works: Creatine 5g daily, Vitamin D3, quality protein powder
- Pre-workouts: Just caffeine 200mg + citrulline 6g + beta-alanine 3g
- Save money, buy raw ingredients instead of branded blends
